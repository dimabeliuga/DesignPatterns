# Design Patterns Repository

## Overview

This repository contains simple programs that demonstrate different **design patterns**. Each pattern has its own folder with a small program written in C++ to show how the pattern works.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to learn and practice design patterns by creating clear and simple examples. These examples can help others understand how to use design patterns in their own projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized by design patterns. Each folder is named after a specific pattern.

### List of Design Patterns

Here are some of the design patterns included in this repository:

- **Creational Patterns:**

  - [Singleton](/include/SingletonPattern/)
  - [Factory Method](/include/FactoryMethod/)
  - [Abstract Factory](/include/AbstractFactory/)
  - [Builder](/include/BuilderPattern/)
  - [Prototype](/include/PrototypePattern/)

- **Structural Patterns:**
  - [Adapter](/include/AdapterPattern/)
  - [Bridge](/include/BridgePattern/)
  - [Decorator](/include/DecoratorPattern/)
  - [Facade](/include/FacadePattern/)
  - [Composite](/include/CompositePattern/)
  - [Flyweight](/include/FlyWeightPattern/)
  - [Proxy](/include/ProxyPattern/)

- **Behavioral Patterns:**
  - [Chain of Responsibility](/include/ChainOfResponsibility/)
  - [Command](/include/CommandPattern/)
  - [Iterator](/include/IteratorPattern/)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dimabeliuga/DesignPatterns.git
2. Navigate to the folder of the design pattern you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd DesignPatterns/[PatternName]
3. Build the program using CMake.
   
4. Check the code and comments to understand how the pattern is implemented.
